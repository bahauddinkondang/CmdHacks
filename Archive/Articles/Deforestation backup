On the contrary, it is commonly argued that deforestation can contribute to the development of agriculture of a country. With the human population growing every year, there is an apparent rise in the demand for food (World Wildlife Fund, 2017). It is necessary to clear forest to grow crops for food to prevent the imminent food crisis. However, this argument is weak as productivity of agricultural activities on deforested land is less due to soil erosion. Soil erosion caused by deforestation will destroy vegetation land cover of soil which is fertile for plant growth. Nutrients and essential microorganisms will be eroded and the soil condition will no longer favour the growth of plants. In the end, this will reduce the yield of crop plants and deteriorate productivity of agriculture, leading to mass starvation in near future (Earth Eclipse, 2018). On the other hand, retaining forest will provide us with sources of meat, crops and other raw materials to prevent famine. Therefore, clearing forest for agriculture is not a wise option.

On the contrary, opponents of this subject believe that deforestation will bring many economic benefits by encouraging human activities such as agriculture. With the human population growing every year, there is an apparent rise in the demand for food (World Wildlife Fund, 2017; Marcoux, 2000).  As a further matter, agricultural activities are necessary to satisfy and sustain human demands. For example, such activities include harvesting timber for producing paper, growing crops and raising livestock for food (Marcoux, 2000). Without agriculture, the human population will have to rely on other alternatives. However, it can be argued that conserving the forest’s natural resources is much more beneficial in the long run than deforestation. Forest is an extremely valuable storage of natural resources and a source of harvest for medicines, woods, meat and other raw materials (Marcoux, 2000). If the forest is protected and conserved properly, these resources will continue to sustain and grow on their own as time goes by which grants a bigger harvest in the future. According to Marcoux (2000), the larger the human population, the larger the deforestation rate. Not only does deforestation destroys all the supplies from the forest just for humans to grow their own supplies, it also harms the ecosystem and pollutes the environment. In fact, natural resources are much more valuable than the resources grown from agriculture due to its scarcity. Therefore, it is extremely important to protect the forest instead of destroying it.





2 agricultures
conversing agricultures
 - dont need human to take care of it
destructive agricultures

- improve human quality
- but indigenous suffer
