when i look the syllabus of ict in mufy, i realised its too basic , too easy, too little, its meant
for people with no background or previous knowledge of programming . 
To me, I have already self taught myself all these things,
I realised that all these academic institutions you see , and waste your life on , in reality, aare just nothing
they are just a waste of time, all these thing can easily online, and self taught programers are beter than qualified programmers, that is the truth.
We are the innovative people, you who goes to university and college for that qualification,
you who does that is blind. You are blind to see anything , so you them teach you things really slowly.
We are different. But you, you are just a baby
