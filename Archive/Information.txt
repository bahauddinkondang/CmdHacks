Gdrive ahve recently or sometime ago added a new feature to direct download a shared folder without adding them to your own account's Gdrive.
This is a tutorial meant for amateurs , as far as I know , most of you who gots this link don't even know how to use Gdrive properly

On windows, to direct download a folder
click the down arrow at the left of a folder to download the folder as a zip file, then extract it using default windows explorer or winrar.
