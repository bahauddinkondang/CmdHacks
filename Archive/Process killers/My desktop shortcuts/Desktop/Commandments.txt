These are my commandments generated from my  own mind, not body, body and mind are seperate decision makers, this is very similar to god's 10 commandments. I shall follow these commandmnets to ensure that I properly live my life without wasting a single thing. 

I admit, I make these mistakes , that is why I created this to ensure that I follow my own commands to repent completely.


In jesus name, I shall repent with my mind and the spirit of my body with the help of jesus, the father and the holy spirit.
I know I can count on you guys.


I think I lost all my lust desires after getting traumatised, the evil spirit does not see any point in possesing me to lust because I am already hating to do such lustful actions such as spanking or whatever do do with dicks, breast, and scream/moaning of our physical body
In Jesus name, I must follow God and Jesus's words , as well as my own principles.

I find myself sinning, for that I seek repentance

I think  at some point , I just got caught in the net, its time to untangle myself and move on
