My computer got infected by a virus that prevents me from opening any browsers!!!!!
Take a look

If you really believed what I wrote earlier,
you just got fooled

I created a cmd or bat file that will kill all your browser processes,
except that it only kills internet explorer , firefox and chrome.

Theres a loop version of it and a version of it without loop.



Rebooted pc

let me show you a version of the cmd file I created without loop
Here's the cmd code


Now, I 'll show you how the looped version of the cmd/bat file looked like
It automatically delete the browser processes so you can't use it as long 
as the cmd window is open


But if you hide it, you can't close its window so it'll run in background forever until you find a 
way to kill its process.

You can also create custom process killer by just editing the cmd file,
lets say you want to kill notepad.exe.
Follow me

copy and paste any of the taskkill cmd

and  type the app / exe process you want to destroy
for now, i 'll use notepad.exe


You can also hide the cmd window by dragging it to the or hidden browser .exe
The cmd window will only appear for 1 second on some occasions
